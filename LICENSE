Preamble

The European Union Public Licence (the ‘EUPL’) applies to the Work (as defined

The original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor

copyright notice for the Work:

Licensed under the EUPL

or has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the EUPL.

  available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its
  essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
  person.

Article 2 – Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested
in the Original Work:

- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
- reproduce the Work,

  the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may

- distribute the Work or copies thereof,
- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
- sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.

Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

Article 3 – Communication of the Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in
a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where
the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor
continues to distribute or communicate the Work.

Article 4 – Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from
any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the
Work, of the exhaustion of those rights, or of other applicable limitations
thereto.

Article 5 – Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
obligations imposed on the Licensee. These obligations are the following:

Attribution right:
The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and
all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The
Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every
copy of the Work he/she distributes or communicates. The Licensee must cause any
Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been
modified and the date of modification.

Copyleft clause:
If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the Original Works or
Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be done under the
terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence, unless the Original
Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence.

Compatibility clause:
If the Licensee distributes or communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof
based upon both the Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence,
this Distribution or Communication can be done under the terms of this
Compatible Licence. For the list of Compatible Licences, see Appendix.

Provision of Source Code:
When distributing or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee must provide
a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this
Source Code will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee
continues to distribute or communicate the Work.

Legal Protection:
This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service
marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary
use in describing the origin of the Work.

Article 6 – Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
hereunder is owned by the Licensor or licensed to the Licensor and that the
Licensor has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings
to the Work are owned by the Contributor or licensed to the Contributor and that
the Contributor has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Article 7 – Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
“bugs” inherent to this type of development.

For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an “as is” basis
and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without
limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects
or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than
copyright as stated in Article 6.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition
for the grant of any rights to the Work.

Article 8 – Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use
of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage,
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage.

Article 9 – Additional agreements

While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to
conclude an additional agreement, defining obligations or services consistent
with this Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on Your
own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original
Licensor or any other Contributor.

Article 10 – Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon “I agree”
or by any other similar means, in accordance with the rules of applicable law.
Clicking on such an icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this
Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by this Licence, such as the
use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution or
Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

Article 11 – Information to the public

In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work, the Licensee shall
provide to the public, where reasonably practicable, the means to access the
Source Code of the Work.

Article 12 – Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such termination will not
terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee
under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the
Licence.

Article 13 – Miscellaneous

Without prejudice to Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
agreement between the Parties as to the Work.

If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law,
this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole.
Such provision will be interpreted and/or reformed so as to achieve its intended
purpose to the greatest extent possible under applicable law.

Article 14 – Jurisdiction

Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this Licence, arising
between the European Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as a
Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of
Justice of the European Union, as laid down in Article 272 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union.

Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Union
institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its
primary business.

Article 15 – Applicable Law

This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union where the
Licensor is a European Union institution, body, office or agency.

This Licence shall be governed by the law of the country where the Licensor
